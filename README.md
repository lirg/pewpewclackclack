# Gun Violence
Team: Able Shi and Roger Li
## Project Topic
Our project seeks to find any trends related to mass shootings, police shootings, and gun violence in the United States. If trends exist, then we want to analyze the relationships and how they trend across the entire country.

## Background and Motivation
It seems like mass shootings and police brutality are increasingly occurring on media outlets. We would like to determine whether this is truly due to increased gun violence, or increased media coverage. Either way, we would also like to examine the relationships of police shootings, mass shootings, and gun violence between each other and also over time.

## Objectives
We want to examine different gun violence trends over time and across the United States. We want to create a UI that'll be user-friendly and effective. We hope to be able to see some surprising relationships or even surprising non-relationships.

## Data
We are aggregating three different data sources - [mass shootings](https://www.kaggle.com/jlmontie/stanford-msa-2017/home), [fatal police shootings](https://www.kaggle.com/kwullum/fatal-police-shootings-in-the-us), and [general gun violence](https://www.kaggle.com/jameslko/gun-violence-data). These datasets were gathered through public datasets.
